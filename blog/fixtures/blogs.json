            "content": "We don’t know about you, but it’s been a hot minute since we went out dancing! \n\nWith 2020 keeping us close to home and dance parties closed down, we are itching for something different. This week we’re thrilled to share 4 new Electronic Music Session classes from some global record labels that will complement your practice and allow you to find your flow on a deeper level. We’re ready to synchronize our breath to our movement and add another element to our customary practices. \n\nVinyasa Flow yoga and electronic music can be perfect partners in your quest to dance with your breath, quiet your mind, and soothe your soul. Vinyasa means to place in a special or sacred way and is an excellent way to build strength, balance, flexibility, and connection. This style of yoga focuses on linking breath and movement to create a moving meditation, which often feels like a powerful dance. Vinyasa Flow classes are varied and creative and each one is as unique as each instructor’s individual style and sequencing. Settling into the rhythm and flow helps you find harmony within yourself and with the world around you. \n\nMusic adds an additional layer to the yoga practice and when the music complements the sequencing and pacing of class, it can truly transform how you feel and how deep you can go within. An appropriate playlist can help you disengage from distracting chatter in your mind and energize or calm your mood, helping you settle into your moving meditation sooner. The powerful vibration of sound can boost your mood and elicit feelings of joy and freedom when an uplifting song comes on or calm your nerves with a mellow tune. A skillful playlist created by an experienced DJ complements the yoga experience on the physical, emotional, and mental levels. \n\nIf you’ve never tried a class with electronic music before, here’s your chance! We’ve got some special classes linking world renowned music and yoga. And if you end up dancing in your living room, you won’t be alone because we’ll be right there with you. So turn down the lights, set up your yoga space, and let’s dance with our breath together. You might be surprised at how profound this experience can be. \n",
