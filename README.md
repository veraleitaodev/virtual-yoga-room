##  Credits
-  Used bootstrap theme [agency](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency) to inspire me in for homepage structure
-   Used previous work and as templates to write README page and [taste world snacks](https://github.com/ceciliabinck/taste-world-snacks.git) deployment as guidance to write up my deployment
-   I have copied and pasted small pieces of work from my first attempt at this project, in the repository [sl_art](https://github.com/veraleitaodev/sl_art/) and [sandra_art](https://github.com/veraleitaodev/sandra_art/) as these were my first attempts to fullfil my milestone project, I have changed project as it was limiting me on the number of skills I could demonstrate.  
In insight, I will improve UX planning before implementing the project to verify it meets all requirements.
